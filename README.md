# Hexapod Controller

Code for controlling a hexapod.

## Features

Configure the dimensions and resting angles of a real (or virtual) hexapod. Define "gaits" as a sequence of vectors that transform foot positions in space either linearly or along Bezier curves, and then IK calculations are performed to determine the correct leg joint angles for each position. Apply gaits to a configured hexapod and run the code to make it move.
